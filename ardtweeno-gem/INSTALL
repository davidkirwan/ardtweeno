# Ardtweeno MVP - Installation instructions
The Ardtweeno system can be installed from https://rubygems.org/gems/ardtweeno through the _gem_ utility, or by checking 
out the codebase from the git repository on https://github.com/davidkirwan/ardtweeno and then building and installing the 
gem using the _rake install_ command.

System gem dependencies can be installed using the _bundler install_ command from the git repository root directory.

Tests can be run with the _rake test_ command from the root of the git repository. The tests may require the tty0tty null
serial modem to have been compiled prior to the tests being executed. This system is bundled with the gem in the following
directory: _tests/tty0tty/pts_. Enter the directory and compile the library with the _make_.

To launch the system, simply type _foreman start -f Procfile -p <port>_

# Ardtweeno - API Sample Scripts
This directory contains a number of scripts which make use of individual aspects of the Ardtweeno API. The idea
is to quickly allow users to get up and running with the API, and give basic examples of what you can do with
using it.

Each example can be executed simply by calling it in the following way:

    ruby <filename>.rb

It will print out some information then output data returned from the gateway. Each example expects the gateway
to be available on http://localhost:4567
